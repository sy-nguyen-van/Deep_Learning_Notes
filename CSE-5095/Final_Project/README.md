This code implements the methods of the paper

**A Maximum-Rectifier-Function Approach to Stress-Constrained Topology Optimization**, J.A. Norato, H.A. Smith, J.D. Deaton, and R.M. Kolonay
*Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization*, 2022.

The MRF method is a technique for stress-constrained topology optimization in which the stress constraint is a differentiable approximation of 
the maximum element-stress violation in the structure. The element-stress violation is given by a differentiable rectifier function. 

The code has input files corresponding to all the examples presented in the paper.
